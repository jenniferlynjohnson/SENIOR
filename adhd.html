<h1>ADHD</h1>
<p style="border:2px solid Black;">After surveying three groups of adults, it was found that most people had the notion that those with Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder were just “hyper” and did not know how to “sit down for a long period of time”. Though both of these statements are true, that is not all that this order consists of consists of. Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder, better known as ADHD, affects not only one’s hyperactivity, but also their attention span and their impulse(Russell A. Barkley).
	When ADHD is affecting one’s impulse, it may be hard for them to face situations involving conflict. They may have the urge to argue or yell at the person they are communicating with. These small disagreements quite frequently results in physical altercations that could all be avoided if the person they were talking to kept their composure.
	When ADHD is affecting one’s attention span, it may motivate them to jump around or fund something else that will entertain them. When those with ADHD begin to jump around and do random things, a lot of people refer to them as hyper and tend to distance themselves from them. It is important to motivate people without this disorder to not distance themselves because it gives the disabled a feeling of separation from the “regular children/people”. Children with ADHD tend to know when they are different from the others once they reach a certain age. Once they reach that certain age, they will feel when they are being isolated from their peers which does not make dealing with their disorder easier.
